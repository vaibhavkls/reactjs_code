1. React Hooks
    How many types of components are there in ReactJS (2)
        Class
            Props -> Parameters / Arguments
            State -> JS object to capture properties
        Function
            Can accept arguments but they do not have state
            I use hooks to use state in functional components as well

    Simple function useState is called when we have to interact with state for functional components
